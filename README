Goal: Achieve a sprint velocity of 3 tasks per person in a sprint of 10 days (2 work weeks). This will allow us to finish 15 tasks every 2 weeks.

Collaboration Tools:
We plan to collaborate through text, and will meet on Zoom once a week outside of our lab section to seek help from each other in completing our tasks. If needed, we will meet more and in person. We will also use Git for finalizing branches and checking on each otherâ€™s work.

Implementation Methodology:
We plan to follow the Agile methodology, essentially saying we will always have a working model that is ready to show. We plan to use Git as our model-based system that will capture our documents and status on tasks. The technologies/tools used will be Python, React, MongoDB.
